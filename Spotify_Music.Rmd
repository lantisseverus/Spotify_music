## Import Data

## Data Exploratory

Filter out artist with only one song:

```{r}
song_cnt = data %>% group_by(artist) %>% 
    count(artist) %>% 
    filter(n > 1)
```


Artist's key distribution


```{r}
key_dist = data[match(data$artist, song_cnt$artist),] %>% 
    group_by(artist) %>% 
    summarize(key_median = median(key), 
              avg_key = mean(key), 
              hightest_key = max(key), 
              lowest_key = min(key), 
              diff = max(key) - min(key)) 

str(key_dist)
```

Can Answer following questions:
Which artist has the widest range?
Which artist has the narrowest range?
Which artist has the highest tone on average?
```{r}
key_dist[which.max(key_dist$diff),] %>% knitr::kable()
key_dist[which.min(key_dist$diff),] %>% knitr::kable()
key_dist[which.max(key_dist$avg_key),] %>% knitr::kable()
```

Pull out the song title with widest/narrowest from the dataset.

```{r}
data %>% filter(artist == "Disclosure" | artist == "20th Century Steel Band") %>% select(artist, song_title, key) %>%  filter(key == 11 | key == 2) %>% knitr::kable()
```
Are these artist only have one song?
